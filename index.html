     <p>Aspiring software developer with an interest in artificial intelligence. 
         Currently working on a full-stack mobile application for iOS and Android as freelance work while I finish school.
         On top of my software development journey, I have also worked on some projects within artificial intelligence. 
         I have a great fundamental knowledge in deep learning and have worked with creating feed-foward neural networks, 
         recurrent nerual networks/long-short term memory networks, conducted research on deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, 
         and am currently working on a text classifying network for natural language processing on news stations. </p>
